JEE Main Syllabus (Paper 1: B.E./B.Tech) – JEE Main covers the full Class 11–12 NCERT curriculum in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. The official syllabus is divided into units for each subject: • Mathematics: 15–16 units covering topics like Sets, Relations & Functions (set operations, types of functions); Complex Numbers & Quadratic Equations (Argand plane, modulus and argument, solving quadratics); Matrices & Determinants (matrix algebra, inverses, solving linear equations); Calculus (limits, continuity, differentiation, integration and their applications); Coordinate Geometry (lines, circles, conic sections); Trigonometry (trigonometric identities, equations, inverse trig functions); Statistics & Probability (measures of dispersion, probability theorems, distributions), and more. The math syllabus spans algebra, calculus, geometry, and statistics, ensuring coverage of all fundamental topics. • Physics: 20 units encompassing Units & Measurements (SI units, errors, dimensional analysis); Kinematics (motion in one and two dimensions, projectile motion); Laws of Motion (Newton’s laws, friction, circular motion dynamics); Work, Energy & Power (work-energy theorem, conservative forces, collisions); Rotational Motion (torque, angular momentum, moment of inertia, rotational dynamics); Gravitation (Newton’s law of gravitation, satellite motion, escape velocity); Properties of Solids and Liquids (elasticity, fluid mechanics, surface tension); Thermodynamics (laws of thermodynamics, heat transfer); Kinetic Theory of Gases; Oscillations and Waves (SHM, wave motion, sound waves, beats); Electricity and Magnetism – Electrostatics (Coulomb’s law, Gauss’s law, capacitors), Current Electricity (Ohm’s law, circuits, Kirchhoff’s rules), Magnetism & EMI (Biot–Savart law, Ampere’s law, forces on currents, AC circuits, electromagnetic induction); Electromagnetic Waves (EM spectrum and applications); Optics – Ray Optics (reflection, refraction, lenses, optical instruments) and Wave Optics (Young’s double slit, interference, diffraction, polarization); Modern Physics – Dual Nature (photoelectric effect, de Broglie waves), Atoms & Nuclei (Rutherford/Bohr models, radioactivity, nuclear reactions); Electronic Devices (semiconductor diodes, transistors, logic gates); and Experimental Skills (measurements using vernier calipers, screw gauge, pendulum, electrical experiments, etc.). This comprehensive list ensures Main covers all essential physics topics. • Chemistry: divided into Physical, Inorganic, and Organic Chemistry: • Physical Chemistry: Units on Basic Concepts (mole concept, stoichiometry); Atomic Structure (Bohr model, quantum mechanics, orbitals); Chemical Bonding (VSEPR theory, hybridization, molecular orbital theory); Thermodynamics (first and second laws, enthalpy, Gibbs free energy); Solutions (concentration terms, Raoult’s law, colligative properties); Equilibrium (chemical and ionic equilibria, Le Châtelier’s principle, pH, buffers); Redox Reactions & Electrochemistry (oxidation number, galvanic cells, Nernst equation, electrolysis); Chemical Kinetics (reaction rates, order, Arrhenius equation). • Inorganic Chemistry: Periodic Table & Periodicity (trends in atomic size, ionization enthalpy, etc.); Chemistry of p-block (groups 13–18 elements); d- and f-block elements (transition metal properties, lanthanoid contraction, important compounds like K₂Cr₂O₇, KMnO₄); Coordination Compounds (Werner’s theory, nomenclature, isomerism, VBT and CFT, importance in biology). • Organic Chemistry: Fundamentals (tetravalency of carbon, functional groups, IUPAC nomenclature, isomerism, electronic effects – inductive, resonance, hyperconjugation; reactive intermediates like carbocations and free radicals); Hydrocarbons – alkanes (conformations, halogenation), alkenes (geometrical isomerism, electrophilic addition, Markovnikov’s rule and peroxide effect), alkynes (acidity, addition reactions), benzene (aromaticity, electrophilic substitution, directive effects); Organic Halides (preparation, properties of alkyl/aryl halides, environmental impacts of compounds like freons, DDT); Oxygen-containing Compounds – alcohols and phenols (acidic nature, dehydration mechanism, Reimer–Tiemann reaction), ethers, carbonyl compounds (aldehydes & ketones – nucleophilic addition mechanisms, Cannizzaro and Aldol reactions, distinguishing tests; carboxylic acids – acidity factors); Nitrogen-containing Compounds – amines (structure, basicity, identification of 1°/2°/3° amines), diazonium salts (synthetic importance); Biomolecules – carbohydrates (glucose, fructose, sucrose etc.), proteins (amino acids, peptide structures, denaturation), nucleic acids (DNA/RNA structure and function), vitamins and hormones; Practical Chemistry – qualitative analysis of elements and functional groups, preparations of inorganic/organic compounds (e.g. Mohr’s salt, acetanilide), and principles of titrations and salt analysis. The JEE Main chemistry syllabus is exhaustive, covering all major topics in physical, inorganic, and organic chemistry. JEE Advanced Syllabus – The JEE Advanced syllabus overlaps with JEE Main but delves deeper into each topic. It is structured by broad subject areas: • Physics (JEE Advanced): Divided into categories like General Physics (units and dimensions, error analysis), Mechanics (kinematics, Newton’s laws, frames of reference, circular motion; also solid and fluid mechanics – Hooke’s law, stress-strain, Pascal’s law, viscosity, Bernoulli’s theorem; plus wave motion, standing waves, Doppler effect), Thermal Physics (thermal expansion, calorimetry, kinetic theory of gases, thermodynamics laws, Carnot engine, blackbody radiation), Electricity and Magnetism (Coulomb’s law, electric field and potential, Gauss’s law, capacitance; current electricity and Kirchhoff’s laws; magnetic fields, Biot–Savart law, Ampère’s law, Lorentz force, electromagnetic induction, AC circuits), Optics (geometric optics: reflection, refraction, lenses, total internal reflection; and wave optics: interference, diffraction, polarization), Modern Physics (atomic structure, photoelectric effect, Bohr’s model, X-rays; nuclear physics: radioactivity, binding energy, fission and fusion). Notably, the JEE Advanced syllabus was updated in 2023 to align more closely with Main; for example, Advanced now explicitly includes topics like semiconductors and communications which were earlier only in Main. Overall, Advanced physics covers all Main topics plus additional depth in areas like wave optics and mechanics. • Chemistry (JEE Advanced): Includes Physical Chemistry (states of matter, atomic structure, chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, solutions, electrochemistry, etc. similar to Main but with more rigorous treatment), Inorganic Chemistry (detailed periodic trends, coordination chemistry, transition metals and their compounds, qualitative analysis), and Organic Chemistry (detailed mechanisms and reactions of functional groups, including polymers and biomolecules). For example, Advanced expects proficiency in concepts like molecular orbital theory, qualitative analysis of inorganic salts, and detailed reaction mechanisms in organic chemistry. Organic Chemistry in Advanced is quite exhaustive – covering General principles (stereochemistry, isomerism, reactive intermediates), all major functional group families (hydrocarbons, alkyl halides, alcohols, carbonyl compounds, carboxylic acids and derivatives, amines), as well as Practical Organic Chemistry (tests for elements and functional groups). The level of detail in JEE Advanced is high; for instance, topics like spectroscopy or more complex named reactions might be indirectly relevant. (The *official JEE Advanced 2025 syllabus note stated it “remains the same as 2024”, after the 2023 revisions.) • Mathematics (JEE Advanced): Largely overlaps with Main, covering Algebra (sets, relations, complex numbers, matrices, permutations, binomial theorem, sequences and series), Calculus (limits, continuity, differential and integral calculus, differential equations), Geometry (coordinate geometry in 2D and 3D, vector algebra), Trigonometry, and Statistics & Probability. Advanced math may include a few extra subtopics or greater depth – for example, solution of triangles, advanced properties of conics, or tougher problems on limits and integrals. However, the 2023 syllabus revision aligned Advanced math closely with Main, so the content domains are similar (the emphasis is on higher difficulty and problem-solving rather than additional topics). Summary: Both exams cover Physics, Chemistry, and Math comprehensively. JEE Main tests foundational knowledge across all standard topics, while JEE Advanced covers the same topics at a deeper conceptual and problem-solving level (with a few niche additions). Students are advised to use the official syllabus from NTA and IITs to guide their preparation, ensuring no topic is omitted. Past Years’ Cutoffs and Rank Trends JEE Main Qualifying Cutoffs: To qualify for JEE Advanced and also for NIT/IIIT admissions, candidates must meet the JEE Main qualifying percentile which is announced for each category each year. This cutoff is the NTA Score (percentile) corresponding to the top ~2.5 lakh candidates. In 2025, the qualifying percentile was 93.1023 for General (Open category), with cutoffs for EWS ~80.38, OBC-NCL ~79.43, SC ~61.15, ST ~47.90 (percentiles). These marks increase slightly most years with rising competition – for instance, General cutoff was ~90.78 in 2023 and rose above 93 in 2025. (Note: admission cutoffs for colleges are different and usually much higher than these qualifying marks.) JEE Advanced Cutoffs: JEE Advanced has its own qualifying criteria (minimum % marks in each subject and aggregate) to be placed in the rank list. For example, in 2024 a general-category candidate needed about 35% aggregate to qualify, with lower thresholds for OBC/EWS (31.5%) and SC/ST (17.5%). Ultimately around 40,000–50,000 students qualify Advanced each year. In 2024, 48,248 candidates qualified JEE Advanced, of whom 7,964 were female. In 2025, IIT Kanpur (organizing IIT) reported 54,378 qualified out of ~180,000 who appeared, with 9,404 female qualifiers. This reflects a ~30% success rate among JEE Advanced test-takers and about 17% female representation in the qualified list. JoSAA Opening/Closing Ranks: Admission to IITs, NITs, IIITs, and other institutes is based on rank lists and each course has an opening rank (first admitted rank) and closing rank (last admitted rank) for each category. These ranks vary by institute prestige and branch popularity. Over the last 3–5 years, trends show consistent domination of Computer Science (CSE) as the most competitive branch: • Top IITs (General Category): IIT Bombay CSE has the highest cutoff – typically closing around AIR 60–70 in JEE Advanced. For instance, IIT Bombay’s B.Tech CSE closed at Rank 66 in 2025 (Round 1) and around 68 in 2024. IIT Delhi CSE usually closes around AIR 100–130, IIT Madras around 160–180. Other older IITs (Kanpur, Kharagpur, Roorkee) also see CSE closing within roughly top 200–300 ranks. These cutoffs have been relatively stable, inching slightly upward as more students compete for limited seats. In contrast, newer IITs (established in the last decade) have less intense competition – their CSE branches might close between ranks 1000–3000, and other branches even lower. As a general trend, “older IITs… have much lower (more competitive) closing ranks – often under AIR 1000 – whereas newer IITs often have closing ranks in the few thousands”. • NITs & IIITs (General Category): For NITs, the top ones like NIT Trichy, Warangal, and Surathkal see CSE closing at around JEE Main Rank ~5000 or better (approximately, as JEE Main ranks are all-India out of ~1 million candidates). For example, in 2025, the opening rank for CSE at a top NIT was around 500 and closing around 4,000 in the general category. Lower NITs or less sought-after branches can have closing ranks well beyond 20,000. IIITs (such as IIIT Allahabad, etc.) for popular branches close in the 5000–10000 range of JEE Main ranks. And GFTIs (other technical institutes) may go even lower. The JoSAA 2025 data shows, for instance, that in NIT+ system, a top course like Electronics & Communication had general opening rank ~2232 and closing ~6947 in one of the rounds. • Category-wise differences: Reserved categories have separate rank lists and higher closing ranks (since those candidates can be admitted with a lower AIR). For instance, if a certain IIT course closes at AIR 200 in Open category, the same course might close around AIR 400 in OBC, and even higher (e.g. AIR 1000+) in SC/ST, owing to reservation quotas. As an example, IIT Bombay CSE’s closing rank for OBC in recent years has been roughly in the 300s, and for SC/ST in the low thousands (since fewer SC/ST candidates attain top-500 ranks). Similarly, NIT cutoffs for OBC, SC, ST are significantly more relaxed than General cutoffs – but the relative competitiveness among NITs remains (e.g. the best NITs still demand the highest ranks even for reserved categories). • Cutoff trends: Overall cutoffs have become slightly tougher each year due to increasing applicants. JEE Main’s qualifying cutoffs rose from ~89 percentile (2021) to ~91 (2022) to ~92–93 (2023–2025) for General. JEE Advanced ranks for top IIT branches have hovered in the same narrow ranges (IIT Bombay CSE has been ~Rank 1–70 consistently). One notable trend is the introduction of EWS category (10% quota) since 2019, which created an additional category – EWS cutoffs are typically slightly lower than General but higher than OBC (for example, IIT CSE EWS closing might be around AIR 120–150). Another trend is the increasing number of female candidates in top ranks, aided by supernumerary seats (leading to more female candidates securing IIT seats at slightly lower ranks than the last male candidate – effectively raising closing ranks for females). It’s important to note that opening/closing ranks differ by round of counseling as well. JoSAA conducts multiple rounds (typically 6 rounds); earlier rounds have higher (more lenient) closing ranks which tighten by the final round. After JoSAA, additional “special/spot” rounds may fill remaining vacancies (particularly for NIT+ system), often allowing ranks beyond the JoSAA last round cutoff to get a seat in lesser-demand programs. Coaching and Preparation Insights Top Coaching Institutes: India’s competitive coaching industry plays a pivotal role in JEE preparation. Prestigious offline coaching centers like Allen Career Institute (Kota), FIITJEE (Delhi), Resonance (Kota), Vibrant Academy, Bansal Classes (one of the original Kota institutes), Narayana and Sri Chaitanya (Hyderabad-based chains), Aakash Institute (now part of BYJU’s), and Vidyamandir Classes (VMC) have long track records of producing top rankers. These institutes offer intensive classroom programs, study materials, and test series. For example, in JEE Advanced 2023, among the top 100 rankers, 34 had prepared with Allen, 28 with FIITJEE, 9 with Resonance, 8 with Sri Chaitanya, and 7 each with Narayana and Motion Education. Such data underscores that a majority of top rankers come from a handful of major institutes. These coaching centers often highlight their success: FIITJEE claimed 3 out of top 10 ranks in 2023, and Allen announced having 4 students in top 10 in 2023, reflecting the intense competition even among coachings to produce toppers. Online Coaching Platforms: In recent years, online and hybrid platforms have gained prominence. Unacademy, Vedantu, PhysicsWallah (PW), BYJU’S (through Aakash and its app), and Coursera/Edtech collaborations offer live classes, recorded lectures, and all-India online test series. Notably, PhysicsWallah (PW), which started as a free YouTube initiative in 2016, has emerged as a low-cost alternative with remarkable results – in JEE Main 2025, PW students secured 5 out of the top 100 AIR (including AIR 9, 12, 13) and three of them scored 100 percentile. In JEE Advanced 2025, a PW student secured AIR 3 (a first top-10 for an online-focused platform). Unacademy and Vedantu have also produced top rankers (e.g. Unacademy had AIR 36 in 2023 as per their reports). The success of these online platforms signals a shift in preparation trends, especially after the pandemic era, with many students either fully relying on online courses or using them to supplement local coaching. Study Material and Methods: Top coachings provide their own exhaustive study material modules, Daily Practice Problems (DPPs), and periodic tests. These materials are known for quality and alignment with the JEE pattern. Institutes also offer All-India Test Series to benchmark students nationally. According to coaching experts, a structured approach covering NCERT fundamentals and extensive problem-solving is key. Coaching classes often teach shortcuts and tricks to solve problems faster and emphasize revision via quizzes and mock exams. Almost all institutes now offer both offline and online modes (or hybrid), and even the offline classes often use technology (recorded lectures, online question banks, etc.). Success Ratios and Trends: The overall selection ratio in JEE is very low (~1% for IITs and ~5% for any decent engineering college via JEE, given ~1.1 million aspirants and ~50k total seats). So even top coaching institutes see a fraction of their enrolled students crack the exam – but they measure success by the “quality” of ranks achieved. As noted, a large portion of top 100 ranks are captured by a few institutes. From a coaching perspective, “success in JEE is 70% dependent on the student and 30% on the institute”, as one coaching founder put it. Many top students enroll in multiple resources (school + coaching + online), though experts caution that too many sources can cause confusion, advising depth with one system over breadth of many. A notable trend is early-start coaching – institutes now offer foundation courses from as early as Class 8–10, and integrated two-year programs in Class 11–12 are common. Some coaching chains partner with schools (especially in Andhra Pradesh/Telangana and Kota) to run “college-cum-coaching” campuses where students prepare for boards and JEE under one roof. This integration helps manage time and align syllabi, though it raises questions about stress levels. Another trend is the expansion of female enrollment in coachings and JEE prep, spurred by increasing female IIT admissions (thanks to reservation of supernumerary seats). Coaching institutes have started scholarship programs for girls and economically weaker sections, making the training more accessible. Offline vs Online: There is an ongoing debate on the efficacy of online vs offline coaching. Many toppers of 2022–2023 credited in-person interaction for keeping them motivated and doubts resolved; Motion’s founder Nitin Vijay observed that students in physical classes often rank higher due to direct teacher contact and a competitive environment. However, online platforms have leveled the field for students who cannot move to coaching hubs – with live doubt clearing, recordings, and affordable pricing (PW’s yearlong course costs were a fraction of traditional fees). The likely scenario is a hybrid model: students use online resources for flexibility and extra practice, but still value face-to-face mentoring. In summary, India’s JEE coaching landscape is robust: Kota, Rajasthan remains a coaching mecca (Allen, Resonance, Vibrant etc.), while Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai also host major centers. The rise of online platforms has democratized access, producing toppers as well. Ultimately, success comes from consistent hard work and practice – coaching provides guidance and competition, but as toppers often mention, self-study and staying motivated are equally crucial. Candidate Demographics and Performance Data Total Applicants Each Year: The JEE Main exam sees over a million registrations every year. In fact, January 2024 saw a record-breaking 12.3 lakh (1.23 million) registrations for JEE Main – the highest ever. For context, in 2023 approximately 11.6 lakh students registered and 11.13 lakh appeared (after accounting for drop-outs) across the two sessions. The number has been on a rise: 2019 had ~9.3 lakh unique examinees, 2020 around 10.2 lakh, and by 2023–2024 it crossed 1.1–1.2 million. This surge is attributed to increasing number of aspirants from all states and the convenience of multiple sessions. Gender Ratio: The engineering entrance space has historically been male-dominated, but the gap is narrowing slowly. In JEE Main 2023, out of ~11.13 lakh test-takers, about 3.57 lakh were female and 8.04 lakh male, i.e. roughly 32% female participation. By 2024, with 12.3 lakh registrants, around 4.07 lakh were female vs 8.25 lakh male (≈33% female). Initiatives such as the IITs’ female supernumerary seats and various coaching scholarships for girls are encouraging more female aspirants. Consequently, the percentage of female JEE Advanced qualified students has improved: in 2018, only ~9% of IIT qualifiers were girls; by 2024 it was ~16.5% (7,964 female qualified of 48,248). IIT admissions for females are further bolstered by the policy to target 20% female enrollment – in 2025, IITs collectively achieved around 20% female intake by using supernumerary seats. Success Rates by Category: JEE Main and Advanced have reservation policies that ensure representation of various categories: 27% OBC-NCL, 15% SC, 7.5% ST, 10% EWS, and 5% horizontal PwD in each category (Open, OBC, etc.). Out of ~11 lakh JEE Main aspirants, the top 2.5 lakh (approximately top 20-22%) qualify for JEE Advanced (with fixed category quotas for Advanced eligibility). Those ~2.5 lakh include roughly 46k female candidates in 2024. Ultimately, about 1.8–2 lakh take JEE Advanced, and around 50k qualify it (≈25–30% of those who appear Advanced). But the true selection rate to IITs is much smaller – only about 16,000–18,000 IIT seats are available, meaning barely ~1.5% of the original JEE Main registrants get an IIT seat. For NIT+IIIT+GFTI (centrally funded) colleges, there are ~45,000 seats, so combined with IITs roughly 62,000 seats are filled through JoSAA counseling in 2025. That corresponds to about 5-6% of JEE Main applicants securing a government college seat via JEE. The success rates differ by category due to reservations: for example, in 2025 the General (Open) category cutoff was 93 percentile (top ~50k students), whereas for SC it was ~61 percentile (which corresponds to a much larger rank number, allowing more modest scorers from SC category to qualify). However, those candidates then compete within their category for limited reserved seats. It’s observed that the representation of OBC, SC, ST in IITs/NITs is now roughly proportional to reservation percentages, although some reserved seats (especially ST in some IITs) occasionally remain unfilled if not enough candidates qualify at the cutoff. Board-wise Performance: A striking aspect of JEE demographics is the disproportionate success of CBSE students compared to state board students. Although only ~11% of India’s higher-secondary schools are affiliated to CBSE, about 59% of JEE Main/Advanced high-performers are from CBSE. Conversely, state board schools constitute 83% of senior-secondary institutions but contribute only ~35% of successful JEE candidates. A survey by Careers360 found CBSE students have a higher success rate partly because NCERT syllabus alignment gives them an edge. The JEE exams are based on the NCERT curriculum, which CBSE strictly follows, whereas many state boards have different curricula or teach in regional languages, making it harder for those students to adjust to JEE’s style. As a result, boards like CBSE and a few state boards known for rigorous science education (like Andhra Pradesh/Telangana) dominate the ranks. For instance, historically in IIT admissions, over half of the selected students often come from CBSE schools. In 2018, it was reported that 73% of IIT entrants came from just two school boards: CBSE (approx 60%) and Andhra Pradesh state board (13%), with the rest split among all other boards. This trend has likely continued with the addition of Telangana board as a major contributor (due to coaching colleges in Hyderabad). To improve this, many state boards are moving toward NCERT textbooks and emphasizing English medium for science, but the effect is gradual. Geographical and Language Demographics: JEE aspirants come from across India, but a significant proportion of top rankers hail from a few states known for competitive exam focus – e.g. Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra. A 2024 analysis showed 54% of IIT Advanced qualifiers came from just 6 states, and 73% from top 10 states (UP, Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra, Rajasthan, Bihar, etc.). This concentration is tied to coaching hub locations and state population sizes. In terms of exam language, the vast majority (> ninety percent) take JEE in English or Hindi. NTA now offers JEE Main in 13 languages, but uptake of regional languages (Gujarati, Bengali, etc.) remains low – meaning language may be a barrier for some regional-board students. In summary, JEE is an exam of massive scale: over a million aspirants, one of the largest competitive exams in the world. Only a single-digit percentage can secure seats at the coveted IITs/NITs. While efforts are on to broaden representation (reservations, female supernumerary seats, regional language papers), the data clearly show better outcomes for those with CBSE/NCERT backgrounds and those who have access to strong preparation resources. The competition grows each year, as indicated by rising cutoffs and applicant numbers, truly making JEE a fierce race for a limited number of seats. Seat Matrix and Counseling (JoSAA) Procedures After the exams, the Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) handles counseling and seat allocation for 114 participating institutions (IITs, NITs, IIITs, and other GFTIs). The process and policies are as important as the exam itself for aspirants. Key aspects: JoSAA Counseling Process: Qualified candidates (JEE Advanced qualified for IITs, JEE Main qualified for others) must register on the JoSAA portal and fill in their choices of institutes and branches in order of preference. Counseling is conducted in rounds (in 2025 there were 6 main rounds). In each round: - A candidate is allocated the highest preferred choice that is available based on their rank and category. - After allocation, candidates have options to Freeze, Float, or Slide the seat. - Freeze – accept the seat and commit to joining that institute/branch (exit further rounds). - Float – accept the seat but still be considered in later rounds for higher preferences across other institutes. - Slide – accept the seat but be considered for higher preference courses within the same institute in later rounds. - Candidates must pay a Seat Acceptance Fee and upload documents to confirm acceptance provisionally. If a candidate neither declines nor pays, they risk losing the seat. - There is a document verification step (online upload and remote verification for 2025) to confirm category certificates, etc. If all checks out, the seat is provisionally allotted till final admission. - If unhappy, a candidate can Withdraw before the last round or simply not accept an offer (then they exit counseling). There is also an option to participate in further rounds if floated/slid. JoSAA rounds happen quickly (each round’s result coming within a few days of the previous). By the final round (Round 6 or 7), candidates have to take a final decision on their allotted seat. The process is strictly merit-based and also takes into account seat quotas (more on that below). The JoSAA website provides a detailed schedule and business rules each year, which outline all these procedures. Seat Matrix and Reservation Policies: Each institute has a fixed seat matrix which specifies how many seats are available in each program and how they are divided among categories. The allocation follows Government of India reservation norms: - General (Open) seats – available to all based on merit (about 40-50% of seats). - GEN-EWS – 10% seats reserved for Economically Weaker Sections (among General category). - OBC-NCL – 27% seats reserved for Non-Creamy Layer Other Backward Classes. - SC – 15% seats reserved for Scheduled Castes. - ST – 7.5% seats reserved for Scheduled Tribes. - Each of the above categories also has PwD sub-reservation: 5% of seats in each category are reserved for Persons with Disabilities (e.g. GEN-PwD, OBC-PwD, etc.). - These reservations are mutually exclusive categories. A candidate’s category (as declared and verified) determines which category’s seats they compete for. If a candidate does not qualify in a reserved category list, they can still be considered for Open seats (open category is essentially “unreserved” seats open to anyone on merit). - There are also a few special quotas: e.g. some Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) have a state quota for home state students; and Some GFTIs have home state or all-India pools. But the major one is in NITs/IIEST: Home State vs Other State quota. In NITs, 50% of seats are reserved for candidates who belong to the same state as the NIT (Home State), and 50% for candidates from other states. This is to ensure regional diversity as well as local opportunity. (For example, a student from Rajasthan will have a better chance to get a seat at MNIT Jaipur under Home State quota than an outsider with the same rank.) Some NITs in North-East and Union Territories have home state quotas with sub-reservations – e.g. NIT Srinagar reserves 90% of its home seats for J&K students and 10% for Ladakh students; NIT Goa reserves 80% of home seats for Goan students and 20% for those from Daman & Diu, etc., as per government policy. • Female Supernumerary Seats: A crucial policy introduced in 2018–2020 is the reservation of supernumerary (extra) seats for female candidates in IITs, NITs, IIITs to improve the gender balance. The goal was to reach 20% female enrollment in each institute. These seats are over and above the normal seat count and are allocated such that they do not reduce the seats for male candidates. Essentially, within each program, a certain number of seats are earmarked as Female-only (which includes the supernumerary seats). For example, an IIT program with 100 total seats might be split into 80 gender-neutral + 20 female-only (supernumerary). Female candidates are eligible for both pools (so a high-ranking female can grab a gender-neutral seat on merit; the female-only seats then go to the next female candidates to ensure at least 20% female in that program). In 2025, all 23 IITs together offered about 18,160 seats, of which around 3,300 were female supernumerary seats to meet the 20% target. NITs and IIITs also have female-only seats as needed to hit 20% in each branch. This policy significantly increased the number of girls in IITs from under 10% to ~20% within a few years. Seat Matrix Numbers: Every year the seat matrix is published before counseling. For 2025, as mentioned: - IITs: 18,160 seats in total (across 23 IITs). These include all categories and supernumerary seats. IIT Bombay, for instance, had 1,360 seats; IIT Delhi ~1239; IIT Kharagpur 1919 (one of the largest). Newer IITs have smaller intakes (e.g. IIT Goa ~165 seats, IIT Jammu ~305). - NITs: 24,525 seats across 31 NITs. The big NITs have 900–1200 seats each (e.g. NIT Trichy ~1160, NIT Suratkal ~1030, NIT Allahabad ~1134), whereas smaller ones or newer NITs have a few hundred (NIT Goa ~224). - IIITs: 9,940 seats across 26 IIITs (incl. newer PPP ones). - Other GFTIs (Government Funded Technical Institutes): 10,228 seats in 46 institutions (these include colleges like IIEST Shibpur, BIT Mesra, and various IIITM/IIEST/GKV, etc.). - In total, 62,853 seats were offered through JoSAA in 2025, marking a slight increase from ~61,000 the previous year. Each year new programs or institutes may be added (for example, a new IIT or new branches in an NIT can increase seat count). Counseling Rounds and Spot Rounds: As noted, JoSAA completes 6–7 rounds. After that, for the NIT+ system (NITs, IIITs, GFTIs), any vacant seats are handed over to CSAB (Central Seat Allocation Board) which conducts Special Rounds (often called spot rounds) in late July or August. In these rounds, candidates who missed JoSAA or want to try for an upgraded seat can participate (even those who didn’t get any seat in JoSAA or withdrew). The cutoffs in these special rounds can be a bit more relaxed for some lower-ranked colleges/branches, as they fill leftover seats – for example, an NIT seat that was unfilled might go to someone with a rank slightly beyond the last JoSAA cutoff. However, top colleges rarely have vacancies by then. For IITs, there are no spot rounds – any seat that remains unfilled after JoSAA is typically lost (IITs occasionally have a few seats vacant if qualified candidates for certain categories are not available). Reservation Policies in Counseling: During seat allocation, a candidate will be allocated a seat only if they meet that seat’s category criteria. An Open category seat can be taken by anyone (unreserved), but an OBC seat will only consider OBC rank holders, and so on. There is also the concept of seat conversion: if in the final round any reserved seats remain vacant (say not enough ST candidates to fill ST seats), those may be converted to other categories as per rules (usually to same category in another pool or to Open in the end). JoSAA Business Rules outline this conversion cascade to ensure maximum seat utilization. Another policy: Top 20-percentile or 75% board exam rule – to take admission in an IIT/NIT, candidates must also satisfy the class XII performance criterion (either 75% marks for General/OBC or 65% for SC/ST/PwD, or be in top 20% of their board). This was waived in some pandemic years but reinstated later. It’s usually verified at the time of admission (not needed for counseling allotment, but required for enrollment). Documentation and Verification: Candidates must produce category certificates, PwD certificates, etc., in prescribed format during counseling. In 2025, this was done by online uploads and remote verification centers. If a candidate fails to produce a valid certificate, they are considered in the Open category (or could lose the seat if they were only eligible via reservation). For PwD candidates with <40% disability who took scribes/extra time, a physical verification is conducted at allotted IIT/NIT to confirm the disability claim. Summary of JoSAA: In simpler terms, JoSAA is the centralized system that “marries” students’ preference lists with the seat matrix under the reservation rules. It ensures merit-based allocation while honoring quotas. Students need to understand choice filling strategy (always list as many choices as you’re willing to join, in true order of preference) and the implications of freeze/float decisions. The process is transparent – after each round, opening and closing ranks for every course are published so candidates can gauge their chances in subsequent rounds. For an aspirant, knowing the seat matrix and reservation details is crucial for realistic goal-setting. For example, if you are an OBC student aiming for IIT Computer Science, you’d check previous years’ OBC closing ranks which might be ~300–400 rather than ~70 of General. If you are from a lesser-represented state, you might have a better shot at your home NIT due to the quota. And female candidates can take heart that supernumerary seats have increased their probability to get into premier institutes (without lowering the required competency too much – they still compete among themselves for those extra seats). All these factors – syllabus to seats – form the dataset of knowledge one needs for JEE preparation and counseling. The exam demands mastery of a vast syllabus, awareness of cutoffs and ranks to target, leveraging coaching or self-study effectively, understanding one’s competition (demographics), and finally a strategic approach to counseling. The information compiled here, drawn from official sources like NTA, IIT-JAB, JoSAA, and leading education analysis, provides a comprehensive picture to aid both preparation and the admission process.
